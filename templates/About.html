  <p>In recent years, digital accessibility has become a crucial aspect of web and software development. One area that requires attention is communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. 
    This project presents a Flask-based web application that utilizes an avatar to interpret and display sign language dynamically.
     The system leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to translate text or speech input into corresponding sign language gestures, which are rendered using an animated avatar.

    The application is built using Flask for backend processing, WebSockets for real-time interaction, and a 3D animation framework such as Three.js or Babylon.js for rendering the avatar.</p>
    <p> The model is trained on a dataset of sign language gestures, ensuring accurate representation of signs. Users can input text or speech, which is processed and mapped to sign language sequences displayed by the avatar.
    
    This solution aims to bridge communication gaps, enhance accessibility, and provide an intuitive way for individuals to understand and use sign language. The system can be integrated into educational platforms, customer service applications,
     and accessibility tools, fostering inclusivity for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
